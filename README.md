## Facebook-Campaigns

Script that I use to check and predict the cost and results of Facebook Campaigns. The campaigns are based upon “click in external links”, so the results that I expect are how much do I need to invest in order to get some numbers of clicks.

## What you can find here?

1. R Scripts

2. Datasets

3. Vignettes

## Deliverables
